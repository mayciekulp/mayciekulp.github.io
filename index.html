    <p id="debintro">This is my best friend, Sarah, or better known as "Imaginary Deborah". Deb is a fellow sophomore 
        here at Juniata College and is currently studying wildlife conservation and muesuem studies. She grew up in Linglestown, PA 
        is one of the iconic baristas at St. Thomas Roasters. Her most infamous claim to fame is her car, 
        <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buick_Century>"Dirty Dan"</a> a 2001 Buick Century.
    <br/>
    <br/>
        Deb and I met during inbound our freshmen year and she was the first friend I made at college. Camping was 
        an absolute diaster as it rained and was freezing the ENTIRE time but meeting Deb made it all worth it. In our spare time, 
        Deb and I like to go adventuring, eat TacoBell, and pester her poor roommate. 
    <br/>
    <br/>
        Deb is arguably one of the most interesting individuals I have had the pleasure of meeting thus far. She is a woman of many interests and 
        talents, including but not limited to slugs, trout, the NYC subway system, fly fishing, and puppeteering. 
    <br/>
    <br/>
        Throughout this Debsite you will find a plethora of Deb, ranging from a crowd favorite "Ask Deb" Q&A to a timeline of her development into the 
        Deb we know and love today.
